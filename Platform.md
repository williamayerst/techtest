# Platform (Dev-Ops) Tech Test

## Abstract

### Introduction

The purpose of this test is to provide a framework for which to discuss your technical abilities during the interview process. There is no 'correct' answer to solve, and no failure based wholly on this technical test. It is an opportunity for you to come up with some ideas in your own time if you so desire, or provide a skeleton on which a 'live' discussion can follow during the interview process.

### Cloud Provider and Specific Technologies

You may select any given cloud provider from [GCP, AWS, Azure] and any relevant technology stack, but do be prepared to justify yourself.

You may use either a specific language or psuedo-code as you feel appropriate.
